# Title
A5: CSV and Dictionaries

## Description
This assignment is about implement the functionality to read the CSV file containing the dataset, building a
dictionary, and producing summary statistics and plots per class.


## Creation 
I've worked on A5 on Python and I followed the assignment guidelines step by step.
The first thing I needed to do is make classes for each species pepal length/width and sepal length/width.
I managed to open the csv file, but I couldn't display the average table of the iris file.
